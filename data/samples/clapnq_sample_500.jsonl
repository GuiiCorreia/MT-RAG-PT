Unlike in the cranium , where one parasympathetic is in charge of one particular tissue or region , for the most part the pelvic splanchnics each contribute fibers to pelvic viscera by traveling to one or more plexuses before being dispersed to the target tissue . These plexuses are composed of mixed autonomic nerve fibers ( parasympathetic and sympathetic ) and include the vesical , prostatic , rectal , uterovaginal , and inferior hypogastric plexuses . The preganglionic neurons in the pathway do not synapse in a ganglion as in the cranium but rather in the walls of the tissues or organs that they innervate . The fiber paths are variable and each individual 's autonomic nervous system in the pelvis is unique . The visceral tissues in the pelvis that the parasympathetic nerve pathway controls include those of the urinary bladder , ureters , urinary sphincter , anal sphincter , uterus , prostate , glands , vagina , and penis . Unconsciously , the parasympathetic will cause peristaltic movements of the ureters and intestines , moving urine from the kidneys into the bladder and food down the intestinal tract and , upon necessity , the parasympathetic will assist in excreting urine from the bladder or defecation . Stimulation of the parasympathetic will cause the detrusor muscle ( urinary bladder wall ) to contract and simultaneously relax the internal sphincter muscle between the bladder and the urethra , allowing the bladder to void . Also , parasympathetic stimulation of the internal anal sphincter will relax this muscle to allow defecation . There are other skeletal muscles involved with these processes but the parasympathetic plays a huge role in continence and bowel retention .","title":"Parasympathetic nervous system"}

An Internet research company , Pew Research Center , claims that `` more than half of internet users ( 52 % ) use two or more of the social media sites measured ( Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Pinterest ) to communicate with their family or friends '' . For children , using social media sites can help promote creativity , interaction , and learning . It can also help them with homework and class work . Moreover , social media enable them to stay connected with their peers , and help them to interact with each other . Some can get involved with developing fundraising campaigns and political events . However , it can impact social skills due to the absence of face - to - face contact . Social media can affect mental health of teens . Teens who use Facebook frequently and especially who are susceptible may become more narcissistic , antisocial , and aggressive . Teens become strongly influenced by advertising , and it influences buying habits . Since the creation of Facebook in 2004 , it has become a distraction and a way to waste time for many users . A head teacher in the United Kingdom commented in 2015 that social media caused more stress to teenage children than examinations , with constant interaction and monitoring by peers ending the past practice where what pupils did in the evening or at weekends was separate from the arguments and peer pressure at school .","title":"Social media"}

This may have been the earliest known occurrence of the idea of an explicit zero worldwide , although it may have been predated by the Babylonian system . The earliest explicit use of zero occurred on monuments dated to 357 AD . In its earliest uses , the zero served as a place holder , indicating an absence of a particular calendrical count . This later developed into a numeral that was used to perform calculation , and was used in hieroglyphic texts for more than a thousand years , until its use was extinguished by the Spanish .","title":"Maya civilization"}

Many of his miracles are also said to have occurred here including his walking on water , calming the storm , the disciples and the miraculous catch of fish , and his feeding five thousand people ( in Tabgha ) . In John 's Gospel the sea provides the setting for Jesus ' third post-resurrection appearance to his disciples ( John 21 ) .","title":"Sea of Galilee"}

This transfer allowed the subsidiary to charge royalties to its European headquarters in Hilversum , Netherlands , effectively converting taxable company profits to an account payable in tax - free Bermuda . Although the subsidiary was effectively run by executives at Nike 's main offices in Beaverton , Oregon -- to the point where a duplicate of the Bermudan company 's seal was needed -- for tax purposes the subsidiary was treated as Bermuda . Its profits were not declared in Europe and came to light only because of a mostly unrelated case in US Tax Court , where papers filed by Nike briefly mention royalties in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 totaling $3.86 billion . Under an arrangement with Dutch authorities , the tax break was to expire in 2014 , so another reorganization transferred the intellectual property from the Bermudan company to a Dutch commanditaire vennootschap or limited partnership , Nike Innovate CV .

A skew apeirogon is an infinite sequence of sides and angles that do not lie in a flat plane . A complex polygon is a configuration analogous to an ordinary polygon , which exists in the complex plane of two real and two imaginary dimensions . An abstract polygon is an algebraic partially ordered set representing the various elements ( sides , vertices , etc . ) and their connectivity . A real geometric polygon is said to be a realization of the associated abstract polygon . Depending on the mapping , all the generalizations described here can be realized .

The payment obligation is independent from the underlying contract of sale or any other contract in the transaction . The bank 's obligation is defined by the terms of the LC alone , and the contract of sale is not considered . So , for example , where party ' A ' enters into an agreement to purchase goods from party ' B ' , Party ' A ' will engage with their bank to create a letter of credit . If said bank is provided certain documents , by ' B ' , then he is obliged to pay , regardless of whether the contract between ' A ' and ' B ' is subject to set - off , or contractual issues . The specified documents are often bill of lading or other `` documentary intangibles '' which ' A ' and ' B ' have previously specified in their original contract . The defenses available to the buyer arising out of the sale contract do not concern the bank and in no way affect its liability . Article 4 ( a ) of the UCP600 states this principle clearly . This is confirmed within the market - practice documents stated by Article 5 of UCP600 . As is a core tenant of Financial law , market practice comprises a substantial portion of how parties behave . Accordingly , if the documents tendered by the beneficiary or their agent are in order , then , in general , the bank is obliged to pay without further qualifications . As a result , it is the issuing bank who bears the risk that is linked with non-payment of the buyer . This is advantageous because the issuing bank often has a personal banking relationship with the buyer . The whole commercial purpose for which the system of confirmed irrevocable documentary credits has been developed in international trade is to give to the seller an assured right to be paid before he parts with control of the goods that . It further does not permit of any dispute with the buyer as to the performance of the contract of sale being used as a ground for non-payment or reduction or deferment of payment . However , the only exception to this may be fraud . For example , a dishonest seller may present documents which comply with the letter of credit and receive payment , only to later discover that documents are fraudulent and the goods are not in accordance with the contract , this would place the risk on the buyer , but it also means that the issuing bank must be stringent in assessing whether the presenting documents are legitimate ...","title":"Letter of credit"}

All the ions travel through ion channels in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells .

Competing against Bruno Brodd of the Irish American Athletic Club and J. Bredemus of Princeton University , he won seven of the ten events contested and came in second in the remaining three . With a total point score of 7,476 points , Thorpe broke the previous record of 7,385 points set in 1909 , ( also set at Celtic Park ) , by Martin Sheridan , the champion athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club . Sheridan , a five - time Olympic gold medalist , was present to watch his record broken , approached Thorpe after the event and shook his hand saying , `` Jim , my boy , you 're a great man . I never expect to look upon a finer athlete . '' He told a reporter from New York World , `` Thorpe is the greatest athlete that ever lived . He has me beaten fifty ways .

One was the decision to build it around a concrete frame , in contrast to many other skyscrapers , which were built on steel frames . Scutt said that a concrete frame was easier to build and was more rigid than a steel frame was . The other was the decision to design Trump Tower as a mixed - use building with retail , office , and residential units . Originally , Trump only wanted to build an office building on the site , but the plot was located in a special zoning district , which specified height limits for most office towers in the area . However , mixed - use towers with public space were exempt from the height limit . The Trump Organization built a five - story , 15,000 - square - foot ( 1,400 m ) atrium , which was legally designated a `` public space '' according to city code , in exchange for permission to add 20 stories to the planned tower . The Trump Organization also constructed terraces on the building 's setbacks , as well as a pedestrian arcade at ground level through the middle of the block , which connected to IBM 's 590 Madison Avenue tower to the east . At the time , the building was the only skyscraper on Fifth Avenue with its own retail space .","title":"Trump Tower"}

The scenes were shot at the revolving restaurant Piz Gloria , located atop the Schilthorn near the village of M\u00fcrren . The location was found by production manager Hubert Fr\u00f6hlich after three weeks of location scouting in France and Switzerland . The restaurant was still under construction , but the producers found the location interesting , and had to finance providing electricity and the aerial lift to make filming there possible . Various chase scenes in the Alps were shot at Lauterbrunnen and Saas - Fee , while the Christmas celebrations were filmed in Grindelwald , and some scenes were shot on location in Bern . Production was hampered by weak snowfall which was unfavourable to the skiing action scenes . The producers even considered moving to another location in Switzerland , but it was taken by the production of Downhill Racer . The Swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule . In March 1969 , production moved to England , with London 's Pinewood Studios being used for interior shooting , and M 's house being shot in Marlow , Buckinghamshire . In April , the filmmakers went to Portugal , where principal photography wrapped in May . The pre-credit coastal and hotel scenes were filmed at Hotel Estoril Palacio in Estoril and Guincho Beach , Cascais , while Lisbon was used for the reunion of Bond and Tracy , and the ending employed a mountain road in the Arr\u00e1bida National Park near Set\u00fabal .

Possibly the worst of these losses was the so - called Fog Bowl in 1988 against the Chicago Bears , which happened to be Ryan 's former team that he helped lead to a Super Bowl XX victory as defensive coordinator . Ryan was fired on January 7 , 1991 , after an upset home playoff loss to the Redskins . Offensive coordinator Rich Kotite was promoted to head coach three days later .","title":"Philadelphia Eagles"}

In areas sprayed during the 1950s local people observed birds such as the American woodcock , American robin , white - breasted nuthatch , brown creeper and various Poecile species dying . Biologist Rachel Carson consequently argued against spraying elms and for improved sanitation , which she saw as having been more effective in areas with earlier and greater experience countering Dutch elm disease . Although modern critics of Carson have argued that the bird deaths were caused by other factors such as mercury poisoning in the soil , spraying against elm bark beetles declined very rapidly after 1962 , a trend aided by fungicides without dangerous side - effects being discovered for the first time after many years of research .","title":"Dutch elm disease"}

However , it is difficult to discern a clear pattern of theory of mind variation due to age .

To legally safeguard the settlers ' investments , possessions and farms on Manhattan island , Minuit negotiated the `` purchase '' of Manhattan from a Manahatta band of Lenape for 60 guilders ' worth of trade goods . According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley , Minuit conducted the transaction with the Lenape chief Seyseys , who was only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for an island that was actually mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks . The deed itself has not survived , so the specific details are unknown . A textual reference to the deed became the foundation for the legend that Minuit had purchased Manhattan from the Native Americans for twenty - four dollars ' worth of trinkets and beads , the guilder rate at the time being about two and a half to a Spanish dollar . The price of 60 Dutch guilders in 1626 amounts to around $1,100 in 2012 dollars .

'' There is currently an ongoing political debate centering on questions of access , efficiency , quality , and sustainability . Whether a government - mandated system of universal health care should be implemented in the U.S. remains a hotly debated political topic , with Americans divided along party lines in their views of the U.S. health system and what should be done to improve it . Those in favor of universal health care argue that the large number of uninsured Americans creates direct and hidden costs shared by all , and that extending coverage to all would lower costs and improve quality . Cato Institute Senior Fellow Alan Reynolds argues that people should be free to opt out of health insurance , citing a study by economists Craig Perry and Harvey Rosen that found `` the lack of health insurance among the self - employed does not affect their health . For virtually every subjective and objective measure of their health status , the self - employed and wage - earners are statistically indistinguishable for each other . '' Both sides of the political spectrum have also looked to more philosophical arguments , debating whether people have a fundamental right to have health care provided to them by their government .","title":"Health care in the United States"}

Grant 's occupation of Belmont , Missouri , directly across the Mississippi River ) . Polk followed this by moving through the Cumberland Gap and occupying parts of southeastern Kentucky . This violation of state neutrality enraged many of its citizens ; the state legislature , overriding the veto of the governor , requested assistance from the federal government . Kentucky was never again a safe area of operation for Confederate forces . Ironically , Polk 's actions were not directed by the Confederate government . Thus , almost by accident , the Confederacy was placed at an enormous strategic disadvantage . Indeed , the early Union successes in the Western Theater ( the locale of all their successful large - scale non-naval initiatives until 1864 ) can be directly tied to Polk 's blunder .","title":"Turning point of the American Civil War"}

According to the fallacy , `` streaks '' must eventually even out in order to be representative . Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman first proposed that the gambler 's fallacy is a cognitive bias produced by a psychological heuristic called the representativeness heuristic , which states that people evaluate the probability of a certain event by assessing how similar it is to events they have experienced before , and how similar the events surrounding those two processes are . According to this view , `` after observing a long run of red on the roulette wheel , for example , most people erroneously believe that black will result in a more representative sequence than the occurrence of an additional red '' , so people expect that a short run of random outcomes should share properties of a longer run , specifically in that deviations from average should balance out . When people are asked to make up a random - looking sequence of coin tosses , they tend to make sequences where the proportion of heads to tails stays closer to 0.5 in any short segment than would be predicted by chance ( insensitivity to sample size ) ; Kahneman and Tversky interpret this to mean that people believe short sequences of random events should be representative of longer ones . The representativeness heuristic is also cited behind the related phenomenon of the clustering illusion , according to which people see streaks of random events as being non-random when such streaks are actually much more likely to occur in small samples than people expect .","title":"Gambler's fallacy"}

Loss of large trees meant that residents were no longer able to build seaworthy vessels , significantly diminishing their fishing abilities . One theory regarding the deforestation that caused such ecological and social damage was that the trees were used as rollers to move the statues to their place of erection from the quarry at Rano Raraku . Deforestation also affected agricultural production on Rapa Nui . At first , the native tropical forests provided ideal shade cover for soil . But with many of the native forest being destroyed , the topsoil became eroded causing a sharp decline in agricultural production . This was further exacerbated by the loss of land birds and the collapse in seabird populations as a potential source of food .

They argued that the embryos of ' higher ' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages , each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being . For example , the brain of a human embryo looked first like that of a fish , then in turn like that of a reptile , bird , and mammal before becoming clearly human . The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this , arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being , based on a single body plan , but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate . Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal body plans : radiate , like starfish ; molluscan , like clams ; articulate , like lobsters ; and vertebrate , like fish . Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation , though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866 .","title":"Evolutionary developmental biology"}

The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression -- the nucleus is , therefore , the control center of the cell . The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope , a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm , and the nuclear matrix ( which includes the nuclear lamina ) , a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support , much like the cytoskeleton , which supports the cell as a whole .","title":"Cell nucleus"}

It has been observed by many evolutionary biologists that fragmented landscapes are often a prime location for adaptive radiation to occur . The differences in geography throughout disjointed landscapes such as islands are believed to promote such diversification . Darwin 's finches occupy the fragmented landscape of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and are diversified into many different species which differ in ecology , song , and morphology , specifically the size and shapes of their beaks . The first obvious explanation for these differences is allopatric speciation , speciation that occurs when populations of the same species become isolated geographically and evolve separately . Because the finches are divided amongst the islands , the birds have been evolving separately for several million years . However , this does not account for the fact that many of the species occur in sympatry , with seven or more species inhabiting the same island . This raises the question as to why these species split when living in the same environment with all the same resources . Petren , Grant , Grant , and Keller proposed that the speciation of the finches occurred in two parts : an initial , easily observable allopatric event followed by a less clear sympatric event . This sympatric event which occurred second was adaptive radiation . This occurred largely to promote specialization upon each island . One major morphological difference among species sharing one island is beak size and shape . Adaptive radiation led to the evolution of different beaks which could access different food and resources . Those with short beaks are better adapted to eating seeds on the ground , those with thin , sharp beaks eat insects , and those with long beaks use their beaks to probe for food inside cacti . With these specializations , seven or more species of finches are able to inhabit the same environments without competition or lack of resources killing several off . In other words , these morphological differences in beak size and shape brought about by adaptive radiation allow the island diversification to persist .","title":"Adaptive radiation"}

HPV E6 causes p53 , which regulates the cell cycle , to become inactive . HPV E7 binds to retinoblastoma tumor suppressing proteins and limits its ability to control cell division .

The Accords recognized the `` legitimate rights of the Palestinian people '' , a process was to be implemented guaranteeing the full autonomy of the people within a period of five years . Begin insisted on the adjective `` full '' to confirm that it was the maximum political right attainable . This full autonomy was to be discussed with the participation of Israel , Egypt , Jordan and the Palestinians . The withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank and Gaza was agreed to occur after an election of a self - governing authority to replace Israel 's military government . The Accords did not mention the Golan Heights , Syria , or Lebanon . This was not the comprehensive peace that Kissinger , Ford , Carter , or Sadat had in mind during the previous American presidential transition . It was less clear than the agreements concerning the Sinai , and was later interpreted differently by Israel , Egypt , and the United States .

Areas that receive higher amounts of UVR , generally located closer to the equator , tend to have darker - skinned populations . Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower intensity of UVR , which is reflected in lighter - skinned populations . Researchers suggest that human populations over the past 50,000 years have changed from dark - skinned to light - skinned and vice versa as they migrated to different UV zones , and that such major changes in pigmentation may have happened in as little as 100 generations ( \u2248 2,500 years ) through selective sweeps . Natural skin color can also darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight . The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight irradiation to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction that produces damage and thus mutations in the DNA of the skin cells . In addition , it has been observed that adult human females on average are significantly lighter in skin pigmentation than males . Females need more calcium during pregnancy and lactation . The body synthesizes vitamin D from sunlight , which helps it absorb calcium . Females evolved to have lighter skin so their bodies absorb more calcium .","title":"Human skin color"}

Working for wages was clearly regarded as subjection to the will of another , but at least debt servitude had been abolished at Athens ( under the reforms of Solon at the start of the 6th century BC ) . By allowing a new kind of equality among citizens this opened the way to democracy , which in turn called for a new means , chattel slavery , to at least partially equalise the availability of leisure between rich and poor . In the absence of reliable statistics all these connections remain speculative . However , as Cornelius Castoriadis pointed out , other societies also kept slaves but did not develop democracy .

The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement . MacDonald wanted to resign , but King George V insisted he remain and form an all - party coalition `` National Government '' . The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on , along with a small cadre of Labour , but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government .

Graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly , with drawings overlapping each other , and display a mix of crude , untrained art , and examples by artists who were familiar with Classic - period artistic conventions .","title":"Maya civilization"}

He went on to say that these seamen received `` fabulous pay for sailors , including overtime bonuses , whereas the navy men draw only the modest pay for their ratings without extras . '' This was a specific allegation , and in February 1943 , the National Maritime Union , representing seven other unions , filed suit for libel against Hearst Newspapers , publisher of the newspaper , and the Associated Press for its wide dissemination of what was claimed to be an untrue story . As part of their suit , they pointed out that Government allotments for families , low - rate premiums on insurance , hospitalization , dental care , pension , and civil service rating consideration tend to balance the pay of ordinary seamen in civilian service . But they denied the incident ever took place , and were backed by a report of Admiral William F. Halsey , commander of United States forces in the South Pacific , to the Navy Department in which Halsey praised the `` co-operation , efficiency and courage '' of the merchant seamen and asserted that `` In no instance have merchant marine seamen refused to discharge cargo from their vessels or in any other way failed to co-operate with the United States forces ashore in that ( South Pacific ) area .
